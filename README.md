# Fandango Movie Rating 

Fandango is an online movie rating aggregator which gives a movie rating from 0 to 5-star. It seems promising, however, in october 2015, Walt Hickey, a data journalist found a discrepancy from the actual rating and the rating diplaied on website. To be more specific, the HTML of the page shows the actual ratings were been rounded up to the nereast half-star for the webpage to display. More detial about the article can be found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).

Here I'd like to investigate the Fandango rating and see if improvement had been make after Hickey's report (2016-2017).
